Section | Project | Task | Status |
--- | --- | --- | ---
Introductory Practice Project | [Titanic Survival Exploration](./titanic-survival-exploration) | Built decision tree classifier by hand to predict Titanic passenger survival. | Done 
Model Evaluation and Validation | [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](./boston-housing) | Used a decision tree regressor to predict Boston-area housing prices. | Done  
Supervised Learning | [Finding Donors for CharityML](./finding-donors) | Used supervised learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression) to classify potential charity donors into two income groups. | Done
Deep Learning | [Dog Breed Recognition](./dog-project) | Trained a CNN to identify dog breeds from images using transfer learning. | Done
Unsupervised Learning | [Creating Customer Segments](./customer-segments) | Used clustering algorithms (K-Means, GMM) to identify customer groups, using historical purchasing patterns. | Done
Reinforcement Learning | [Train a Quadcopter How to Fly](./quadcopter-project) | Used reinforcement learning to (somewhat successfully) teach a quadcopter how to hover in place. | Done
Machine Learning Capstone | [Capstone Projet](./capstone-project) | Used several supervised learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to predict whether a peer-to-peer loan will be repaid, or default, using a historical Prosper loan dataset. | Done
