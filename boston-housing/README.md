## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

### Summary

In this project, I evaluate and optimize the performance of a decision tree regressor in predicting historical Boston-area housing prices.

The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](./boston_housing.ipynb), while the html export of this notebook can be found [here](https://eskrav.github.io/udacity-machine-learning/boston-housing/boston_housing.html).

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
