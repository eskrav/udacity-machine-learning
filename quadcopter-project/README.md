## Project: Train a Quadcopter How to Fly

### Summary

In this project, I used reinforcement learning to (partially successfully) teach a quadcopter how to hover in place, by programming the task, designing the reward function, and modifying the DDPG learning algorithm.

The Jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here](./Quadcopter_Project.ipynb), while the html export of this notebook can be found [here](https://eskrav.github.io/udacity-machine-learning/quadcopter-project/Quadcopter_Project.html).

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
